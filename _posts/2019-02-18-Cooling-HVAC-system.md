**Q: Loss Head in coolant flow?**

A: 
The ¡®Loss¡¯ generated in coolant flow contains two parts: 
	Major loss <-- Friction of flow path.
	Minor loss <-- Velocity change in bends/valves.
To calculate the total loss in coolant flow system:

**Q: Epsilon¦Å(thermal effectiveness) - NTU(number of transfer units) method applied to Radiator?**

A: 
To describe the heat exchange performance of Radiator, two factors were induced: one is the ¦Å(thermal effectiveness); the other one is NTU. These two factors can directly indicate the **effective heat power** exchanged through the Radiator. 

The Epsilon-NTU method details is shown below.
