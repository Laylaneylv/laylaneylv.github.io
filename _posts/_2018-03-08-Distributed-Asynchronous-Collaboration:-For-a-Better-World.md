Distributed Asynchronous Collaboration: For a Better World


## Introduction

This article intends to be an English re-writing of my previous two blogs [构想：中文文本标注工具](http://www.crownpku.com/2017/11/09/%E6%9E%84%E6%83%B3-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E6%96%87%E6%9C%AC%E6%A0%87%E6%B3%A8%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7.html) and [分布式异步协作让世界更美好](http://www.crownpku.com/2017/11/28/%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83%E5%BC%8F%E5%BC%82%E6%AD%A5%E5%8D%8F%E4%BD%9C%E8%AE%A9%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E6%9B%B4%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%BD.html). I'm re-writing in English for sharing with my international colleagues at Swiss Re as well as to the English speaking community.

As you may know I joined Swiss Re Hong Kong not long ago as a Data Scientist. Swiss Re is the second largest reinsurance company globally, and it's amazing how emoumrous data and projects we have at hand to fully embrace the world of automation and intelligence. 

However what amazed my most during my still-short time at Swiss Re is the working style, which Swiss Re calls "Own the way you work". We are encouraged to work from home when appropariate. And more interestingly, in our office at Wanchai each and every employee from interns to directors does not own a permanent desk. Instead we are given a fancy suitcase called "Hot Box", and we are asked to carry such suit case and sit anywhere we want in the spacious two floors of office. Especially for data scientists like me, we are encouraged to switch desks frequently so that we can meet more colleagues, understand their needs, and see if we can help with data science.

Of course at Swiss Re we have Microsoft products and network proxies everywhere, and for data scientists this is sometimes painful. But the "own the way you work" style is already too cool to be true at such a big company. This inpires me to share my previous view of working style again, this time in English.

I will talk about the technical details of the open source project [Chinese Annotator](https://github.com/crownpku/Chinese-Annotator) in Part I, and then share my experience of such collaboration work in Part II.

## Part I: Annotator for Chinese Text Corpus
